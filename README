= Rescue Pack for FW 5.x (KT/PW/PW2/KT2/KV/PW3/KOA/KT3) =
=========================================================

VERSION: 2013-12-20
*Id*

Q: What is this, and why would I need it?
A: This is a package which will (hopefully) allow you to recover your Kindle,
   in cases where it refuses to boot normally. It's really meant mostly for
   developers, and it may help to get the Kindle into a working state again,
   if it happens to be bricked. If you're not a developer, or if you never
   heard about SSH before: I still recommend to install it. If your Kindle
   happens to suicide (and history shows that Kindles regularly simply break
   all by themselves), you still have a chance to restore it, instead of
   having to send it straight back to Amazon. HOWEVER: If you are unsure of
   what you are doing, by all means, don't attempt to do things you don't
   understand, but ask in the Kindle developer's forum:
   http://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=150

   Of course: this "rescue pack" is not a magic bullet in any way. It merely
   gives you SSH access to the Kindle. It's up to you to figure out the
   correct commands to actually debrick the device.

Q: What does it do?
A: Two things. First, it installs the dropbear server on the diags partition,
   so that you can connect to it when in diags mode. Second, it installs a
   tiny script which, when the Kindle boots to (or tries to boot to) main,
   checks for the file /mnt/us/ENABLE_DIAGS. If that file is present, it is
   deleted, and the device reboots into diags mode. Note that this behavior
   slightly differs from what previous Kindle models did, in that a) the
   ENABLE_DIAGS file is deleted right after it was found, and b) you will
   need to explicitly set the boot mode back to "main" if you want to reboot
   to main.
   NOTE: You can also choose to extend this behavior by installing the
   Coward's Rescue Pack (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=232507),
   which will trigger a reboot into diags if the device is connected to a power source
   during boot.

Q: How do I install it?
A: Copy the update_rescue_pack_*.bin file to your Kindle (put it in the root
   USB folder, not into any subfolder), then disconnect the Kindle from the
   computer and select Menu > Settings, Menu > Update Your Kindle.
   Alternatively, you can use the MobileRead Package Installer (MRPI for short):
   http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=251143
   NOTE: if you're currently running FW >= 5.6.x, you will *have to* use MRPI.

Q: How do I use it?
A: There should be at least a short period of time during which even a
   bricked Kindle will show up as a USB drive, when it is booting while
   connected to a computer. During that time, place a file called
   "ENABLE_DIAGS" directly on the Kindle drive (Note: the filename *IS* case
   sensitive... and: *NO FILE EXTENSION*, i.e., it's really "ENABLE_DIAGS",
   not "ENABLE_DIAGS.txt" or anything like that. If you're using Windows,
   double-check your settings, or better yet, just switch to a decent
   Operating System :-p )

   Once the Kindle has rebooted into diags mode, issue the following onscreen
   commands, in sequence, to enable SSH access: N-U-Z-X.
   The Kindle should show up as a networked device soon thereafter (if it
   doesn't, disconnect and reconnect it). The *Kindle* will use the
   following network configuration: IP 192.168.15.244, netmask 255.255.255.0.
   Unless you are trying to do anything exotic, set the *Computer*'s end of
   the connection to IP 192.168.15.201 (netmask 255.255.255.0).

   You should now be able to connect to the Kindle using SSH with the
   following settings:IP=192.168.15.244, USER=root, PASSWORD=mario

   Once you're done with your modifications and fixes, and want to reboot the
   Kindle into "normal" (main) mode, issue the following commands through SSH:

   idme -d --bootmode main
   reboot


Important note:
---------------

While this package should enable folks to remedy some "stupid mistakes" that
they made, and should normally allow for a debricking in most "normal"
situations, it will not help in situations where the PW is *severely* bricked
(like, the main partition can't be read, the entire storage has been deleted,
etc.). To support such situations, we need to find out how the device can be put
into "firmware flash" / "usb downloader" mode. Until then, a sane main
partition, and working upstart scripts, are still required in order to even
boot into diags mode. (This does not hold for the Kindle Touch. The Kindle
Touch can almost always be debricked using USB downloader mode).


PS: If you're tired of the constant SSH warnings, put something like the
following in your .ssh/config file: (the "kindle" is an alias that I defined
in my /etc/hosts file, so YMMV)

Host 192.168.15.244
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null

Host kindle
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
